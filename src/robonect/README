description: This is a ROS stack that simplifies the control of an xBox Kinect motor using a generic linux joystick ( xBox gamepad).
		In addition a tf transform is published which will translate from the kinect to /base_link.
		It is composed of 3 packages, each of which contains it's own README.
		Finally pc_rototranslator grabs the pointcloud and corresponding transform to create a new pointcloud in the correct frame of reference in soft real time.
