name: kinect_tf.cpp
author: Vittorio Alfieri

purpose: Read angle from Kinect, and publish the corresponding tf transform from /base_link to /camera_link.

How it works: Listens to /cur_tilt_angle and /camera/depth/points, and publishes a stamped transform on with latest angle and sensor_cloud timestamp.

Requires: kinect_aux, ros, openni driver
